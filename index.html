    <h2 id="textclass">Suryanamaskara</h2>
    <p>
      Surya Namaskar is the Sanskrit name for a specific sequence of twelve yoga
      asana, otherwise known as a Sun Salutation. It is one of the most widely
      known yoga practices, incorporated into several different traditions such
      as Hatha, Vinyasa and Ashtanga. The term is derived from two Sanskrit
      roots; surya, meaning "sun" and namaskar meaning "greetings" or
      ‘salutations’". <br />
      Traditionally, the practice of Surya Namaskar was used as a means of
      paying respect to the sun. In Indian culture from which the practice came,
      the sun is regarded as the source of all life, and it is therefore of
      great importance. In Hinduism, Surya is the God of the sun, understood to
      be the creator of the universe, and in Vedic tradition the sun is symbolic
      of consciousness and the Divine. As such, Surya Namaskar is considered to
      be one of the most important yoga practices. Surya Namaskar is also
      referred to as Sun Salutation in English.

    <p>
      Pranayama, pronounced "praa-nuh-yaa-muh," is an ancient yogic practice
      focused on controlling and regulating the breath. This involves various
      breathing patterns and exercises designed to increase prana, the vital
      life force energy that flows through us.
